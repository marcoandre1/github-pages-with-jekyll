# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about programming and stuff that I like!

## Programming

I started a software engineering degree in january 2017 at Université Laval in Québec. Since there, I have been improving my coding skills. Main Interest at the moment is

```
Vue js
```

### Other stuff

I mainly like science and music. In fact, I have a degree in chemistry and I attended music conservatory for nearly 4 years in classical piano.
